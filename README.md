Fork of [YUI 2.x](https://github.com/yui/yui2) (now deprecated) for Jenkins.

The Builder project has been incorporated directly into the project to make it easier to build.  The build depends on
[Ant v1.7+](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

To build the Jenkins specific package:

```
ant package-yui-jenkins
```
